Used mobile and tablet pricing dataset : 

The used and refurbished device market has grown considerably over the past decade as it provide cost-effective alternatives to both consumers and businesses that are looking to save money when purchasing one.
Maximizing the longevity of devices through second-hand trade also reduces their environmental impact and helps in recycling and reducing waste.
